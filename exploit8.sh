%n writes the length of the string before %n to where it points to (the address after %n)
%h$x writes the length of the string to the hth argument -> specific position on the stack
so, we can write the address of the variable to be modified before the %n, this will be stored as 
an nth argument on the stack -> find what n is and construct %h$n where h=n
